### Scope and usage 
This profile is used as the Encounter resource for the MedCom HospitalNotification message. The MedComHospitalNotificationEncounter contains (beside references as shown below) identifier and code for sending notification messages.  
The HospitalNotification message is sent without patient acceptance and only a limited data set is allowed to transmit due to Danish legislation. For this reason, is the HospitalNotificationEncounter profile quite narrow.
